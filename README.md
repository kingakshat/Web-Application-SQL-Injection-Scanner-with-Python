# Web Application SQL Injection Scanner with Python

SQL injection vulnerabilities are caused by the lack of sanitation of user input, allowing attackers to execute DBMS queries that could compromise the entire system. This type of web vulnerability is very common.

A successful SQL injection exploit can cause significant damage to the database and web application. For example, it can read sensitive data such as user passwords from the database, insert, modify, and even delete data.

## Python Modules Used:

- `requests`: A Python library used for sending HTTP requests.
- `BeautifulSoup`: A Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents, useful for web scraping.
- `sys`: A module providing access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.
- `urllib.parse`: A module to manipulate URLs and deal with query strings.

## Under Progress:

We are currently working on integrating Nmap to quickly scan web servers for SQL injection vulnerabilities. With the network-scripts Nmap, we can also include Web Application-based NSE scripts like `http-csrf`, `http-dombased-xss`, `http-stored-xss`, `http-phpmyadmin-dir-traversal`, `http-sql-injection`, `http-enum`, etc., which are very helpful in identifying vulnerabilities in web applications within a short span of time. Stay tuned for updates!
